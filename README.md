## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m currently learning Python and using Tkinter to build simple desktop applications as part of my journey into programming. This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly projects where Iâ€™m exploring the basics of Python and getting hands-on experience with GUI development.

Working with Tkinter has been a great way to bring Python programs to life through interactive interfaces. From buttons and input fields to layout design and event handling, Iâ€™m learning how to build applications that users can actually click, type, and interact with. It's exciting to see how just a few lines of code can turn into a functional window or tool.

My focus right now is on understanding programming fundamentalsâ€”such as variables, loops, functions, and conditional logicâ€”while also learning how to apply those concepts visually through small, manageable projects. Iâ€™m also practicing how to structure my code, keep things organized, and write in a way thatâ€™s clean and readable.

This repository includes projects like simple calculators, to-do lists, form-based apps, and other small tools that help reinforce my understanding of Python and GUI development. Each project represents a step forward in my learning process, and I try to add comments and notes throughout the code to track what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

If youâ€™re also learning Python or curious about Tkinter, feel free to explore the projects, give feedback, or even fork a project and try your own version. Iâ€™m always open to learning from others and improving with each project.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to learning Python, one GUI project at a time!
